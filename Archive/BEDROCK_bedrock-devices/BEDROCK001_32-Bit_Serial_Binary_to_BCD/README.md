A nice, and fast 32-Bit Serial Binary to BCD converter for Minecraft Bedrock Edition
## Input
32-Bit No., reset button, and calculate button
## Output
10 digit BCD No.
## Speed
103 RT
## Notes
Uses pistons (Not Solid State), and only works in Bedrock Edition since Java QC breaks it. When loading the structure, load "BCD2B - 1" first then go to the 2nd structure block that comes with "BCD2B - 1" and load "BCD2B - 2" but change the y offset to 0.
