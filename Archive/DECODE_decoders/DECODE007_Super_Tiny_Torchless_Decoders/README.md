Two variations of torchless decoder (tristate and regular). Tristate has one barrel protruding that makes it 4 wide, while normal torchless is 3 wide.
## Input
3-bit flipped binary number (For tristate, there are 3 don't care "X" bits)
## Output
8 result bits (Inverted!) (A: 1ss, B: 15ss)
## Speed
A: 1 tick, B: 2 ticks
## Notes
Torchless A - Regular 3-wide torchless decoder, 1 tick 1ss out (Pictured)
Torchless B - Regular 3-wide torchless decoder, 2 tick 15ss out
Tristate A - Tristate decoder, 1 tick 1ss out (Pictured)
Tristate B - Tristate decoder, 2 ticks 15ss out
OUTPUTS ARE INVERTED
not expandable!
