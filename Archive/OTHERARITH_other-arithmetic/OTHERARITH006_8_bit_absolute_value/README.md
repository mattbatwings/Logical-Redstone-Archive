Description
An 8 bit absolute value function (2s complement).
## Input
8 bit input
## Output
8 bit output (1/6 ss, so use repeater)
## Speed
6 ticks
## Considerations
- I haven't put any time into making it fast or small, so please if you can make a smaller and faster version. I just added a inverted adder and a toggle based on the signed bit.
## Notes
IMPORTANT: top most bit (MSB/signed) has to be connected to the staircase at the bottom, so if you want to make it smaller (like 5 bit) you have to connect the 5th bit to the torch at the bottom!

ALSO make sure that when you make it smaller the top layer stays identical.
