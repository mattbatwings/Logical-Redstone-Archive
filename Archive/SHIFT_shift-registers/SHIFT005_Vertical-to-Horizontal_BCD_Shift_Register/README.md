Modified, very simple version of matt's decoder from his first calculator. Tileable.
## Input
1 nybble
## Output
1 nybble(locked)
## Speed
2rt
## Notes
Repeater on the locking line in the image is an error. In the schem, there is no repeater and you will have to add them as needed. Tileable on the wires. also, works quite nicely for a fast input solution for calculator screens.
