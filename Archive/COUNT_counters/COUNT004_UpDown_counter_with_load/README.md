A compact counter (the base is 7x9 blocks) that permit to count up, down and to load any 8 bit number
## Input
8-bit number, load button, count button, up or down lever
## Output
8-bit number

the count is 4 ticks and the load 6 ticks

The output can seems asynchronous, but it's just the redstone lamps that turn on faster than it turn off. The redstone signal is synchronous.
