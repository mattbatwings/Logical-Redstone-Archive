  "definition": "Guide to data storage sizes:\n\n**Bit**: The smallest unit of data, representing a 0 or a 1 in binary. Abbreviated as b\n\n**Nibble**: One hexadecimal \"digit,\" representing either **4 bits** or the 16 states of redstone dust.\n\n**Byte**: Equivalent to **8 bits or 2 nibbles**. This is a very common unit of data storage in redstone. Abbreviated as B (not to be confused with b, bit)\n\n**Kilobit**: Equivalent to 1000 bits or 125B. Not very commonly used since powers of 1000 are not usually practical in the context of redstone. Abbreviated as kb or Kb\n\n**Kibibit**: Equivalent to 1024 (2^10) bits or 128B. Abbreviated as Kib.\n\n**Kilobyte**: Equivalent to 1000 Bytes or 8 Kb. Abbreviated as KB.\n\n**Kibibyte**: Equivalent to 1024 (2^10) Bytes, 8192 bits, or 8 Kb. Used when referring to the size of large quantities of memory in redstone. Abbreviated as KiB.",
