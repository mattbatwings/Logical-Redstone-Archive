  "definition": "A data structure where inputs are stored in a specific order. When a value is requested, the last value inputted is the first value out. (LIFO, Last in first out)\n\ni.e. if the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 are pushed (inputted into the stack) in that order, popping (requesting values from the stack) will give 4, 3, 2, 1 in that order.\n\nCall stack: A specialized stack in a computer which tracks which instruction a function was called from so that it can return to the appropriate address when the function finishes.",
