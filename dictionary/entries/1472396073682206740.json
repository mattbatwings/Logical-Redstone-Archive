  "definition": "Two different ways of powering blocks which allow signals to travel through blocks.\n\nHard power - Created when powering a block with a repeater, comparator, torch, observers, levers, pressure plates etc. This allows redstone dust adjacent to that block to be powered as well as repeaters, comparators, lamps, etc.\n\nSoft power - Created when powering a block with redstone dust. Redstone dust adjacent to this block will not be powered, however components such as lamps, comparators, repeaters and torches will still be activated.",
