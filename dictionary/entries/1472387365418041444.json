  "definition": "A buffer for displays which allows a device to write to a display without the new data being instantly shown on the display. This allows full frames to be written to a screen at once.\n\nSR-latch buffer: A buffer using SR-latches, typically where all pixels are reset at once, and set to \"1\" when triggered.\n\nD-latch buffer: More flexible than an SR-latch buffer, allowing pixels to be set to \"0\" or \"1\" when triggered.\n\nPictured: D-latch buffer from the 16x16 pixel display from RWPU. The first repeater lock (D-latch) is the buffer, and the second repeater lock is for the currently displayed frame.",
