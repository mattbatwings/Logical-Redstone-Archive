  "definition": "A form of CPU architecture where an accumulator and (often) a single read register file are used. This allows instructions to fit in a much smaller space (as little as 8 bits for an 8 bit CPU) at the cost of more instructions. It can also allow for a faster clock speed.\n\nAn accumulator is a special register which is updated to the result of an ALU operation every time one occurs.\n\nIn a typical ALU operation, the first 4 bits are the opcode, and the next 4 bits are the register to operate on. For example, doing \"add r5\" does accumulator += r5. Instructions are also needed to swap the value in the accumulator with the register. The inputs into the ALU are the accumulator, and the other operand.\n\nCertain accumulator based architectures do not use registers (instead only having RAM), which can improve performance since less instructions are used to swap data between RAM and registers.",
