  "definition": "A form of CPU architecture where an accumulator and single read register file are used. This allows instructions to fit in a much smaller space (as little as 8 bits for an 8 bit CPU) at the cost of more instructions. It can also allow for a faster clock speed.\n\nIn a typical ALU operation, the first 4 bits are the opcode, and the next 4 bits are the register to operate on. For example, doing \"add r5\" does accumulator += r5. Instructions are also needed to swap the value in the accumulator with the register.",
